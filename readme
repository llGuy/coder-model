# CS229 Final Project

## Setup:

`cmake -S . -B build`
`cd build && make -j10`

To run the training code:
`./train.sh`

## Tensor layouts:

Assuming a batch size of 1:

The layout of the observation tensor is a vector of dimension 1+15 = 16
The layout of the action tensor is a vector of dimension 5+6+20=31

## Reward system (for now):
If the generated token is invalid, reward is -1
If the generated token is valid, reward is 1
If after the generated token, an IO pair matches, reward is 10
