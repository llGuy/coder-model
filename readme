# CS229 Final Project

## Data formats:

### Network output data format:

30 ordered entries each of the following format:
```[5-Float32]``` - A probability vector denoting probabilities for each instruction at this entry.
```[6-Float32]``` - A probability vector denoting probabilities for each of the 6 possible lvalues.
```[26-Float32]``` - A probability vector denoting probabilities for each of the 6 register rvalues and 20 literal rvalues.

A norm zero output vector corresponds to a nop instruction, thus any output can have less than 30 functional instructions.

### Network input data format:

1000 input output pairs. There may be 0-3 inputs and 0-3 outputs.
The io-pairs file has the following format:

```[uint8]``` - number of inputs
```[uint8]``` - number of outputs

single io-vector:
```[uint32][uint32][uint32][uint32][uint32][uint32]``` - in0 in1 in2 out0 out1 out2
x1000
