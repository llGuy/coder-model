# CS229 Final Project

Neural Network data format:

30 entries, 

	 entry format:
	 	5-vector instruction probabilities
		6-vector lvalue probabilities
		26-vector rvalue probabilities
		a norm zero vector corresponds to a nop.

Test the following arch:

	relu relu branch for each section
	relu relu massive hidden layer
